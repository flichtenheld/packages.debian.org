search_packages.pl:
- all searches:
  - Display "$pkg ($section) shortdesc from stable (or if not available, testing, unstable, ...)"
    tersely on one line each, with "#foo" links to what's currently displayed.
  - The 'extended' can maybe also have full descriptions then (maybe add did
	to _small.db?)
  - Unify exact & subword -- reduce naming confusion with 'exact' meaning
	either "exactly the same" or "full word"
  - When doing substring searches, hilight with html backgroup color (css of
	course) the search term
- exact package searches
- substring searches on packages:
  - don't do exact lookups, but use '^' prefix token
  - only do for >= 2 characters
  - don't allow whitespace in it, warn when people use common wildcards like
	*, ?, ^, $ (not possible)
  - When overflow, iterate the first couple of packages that *start* with the
	substring, if any? Maybe list those first, and only then real substring
	search?
  - In db, add "abc: too many matches" to postfixes when there's a "abcd: 90
	matches" and abce: 90 matches"

- fulltext search:
  - Max 100 results
  - Better exact=1 performance by indexing per word?
  - drop case-sensitive from options, descriptions.txt all lowercase and without
	punctuation, such that instead of =~ //, indexof can be used

General:
- Try to break everything with empty/short searches
- Check for case sensitive consistency
